⚙️ Getting StartedFollow these steps to set up and run the project locally:Clone the repository:git clone <repository_url_here>
cd modern-travel-app
Install dependencies:npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
Run the development server:npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.📦 Building and DeploymentTo prepare the application for production and deploy it:Build the application:npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
This command creates an optimized production build in the .next directory.Start the production server (for SSR/SSG):npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
This will serve the optimized build.Static Export (if deploying as a static site):If your next.config.js is configured for static export (output: 'export'), run:npm run build
The static files will be generated in the out directory. You can then deploy these files to any static hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Apache, Nginx).🤝 ContributingContributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome!
