## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url_here>
    cd modern-travel-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## 📦 Building and Deployment

To prepare the application for production and deploy it:

1.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    # or
    pnpm build
    ```
    This command creates an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.

2.  **Start the production server (for SSR/SSG):**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    # or
    yarn start
    # or
    pnpm start
    ```
    This will serve the optimized build.

3.  **Static Export (if deploying as a static site):**
    If your `next.config.js` is configured for static export (`output: 'export'`), run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The static files will be generated in the `out` directory. You can then deploy these files to any static hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Apache, Nginx).
